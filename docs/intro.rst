Introduction
============

This file documents the operations required to utilize EnergyPlusRegressions in
doing development and testing. The program consists of a series of
python scripts, that can be utilized in both a command
line/scripted/non-interactive environment, as well as in a graphical
user interface mode.

The current testing includes regression testing of the example files
that are included in EnergyPlus development.

History/Credits
---------------

This program was based on a test suite used at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL) that was developed by Kyle Benne and Jason
Turner, and consisted of both ruby and python scripts, including a job
manager to allow multiple threads to run concurrently. Although this
script was at the heart of the inspiration for creating this current
tool, very little of the original code exists.

The mathematical comparisons performed on the EnergyPlus output files
(MathDiff and TableDiff) were developed originally by Santosh Philip and
improved by Amir Roth. Modifications were made to improve interaction
with the test suite tool and to support Python 3, but the core of the
mathematical comparisons remains.

Build Structure
---------------

This program operates on EnergyPlus build folders.  It relies on the
build folders having been set up by CMake, as it parses the CMakeCache
to get access to the base source directory.  With the build and source
directories available, the program has everything it needs to run.

Known issues
